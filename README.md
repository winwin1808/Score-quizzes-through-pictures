# Score quizzes through pictures using CV2 library

* **Ex2: From the Data folder, generating student.csv         -> student_INFO.csv**

* **Ex3: Generating grading.csv                               -> grading.csv**

* **Ex4: Generating the final result (pass/fail) of the class -> Final Result.csv**

* **Code.py** is the file where we solve problems to get results.

* **Code.ipynb** is the file where we display the printed results.

* **Test.py** is our file to transform image but it's not needed in this case.
